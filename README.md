# GEOTebak

## Overview

GeoTebak is a country name guessing game with helpful hints to guide you!

- Hints available for country facts, landmarks, food, continents, flags, and more
- Stage, level, and timer system
- and more to explore

## How It Works

The game picks a random country from the dataset, then waits for your input.
If you type the correct country name before the timer runs out, you move on!
But if time runs out and you still haven't guessed then it's game over.

## How to Use

Assuming you've forked the repo and are running a local server or using the demo app:

1. Click the Start Game button
2. Wait while the game picks a random country
3. Type a country name into the input field
4. Keep guessing until you run out of time and the game ends!
